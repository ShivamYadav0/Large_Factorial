# Large_Factorial

It is a simple website through which you can find the complete factorial of any large number
smaller than 10000.

As we have seen our calculator doesn't gives us complete or exact value of 
factorial of number generally greater than 20 but
this app gives complete factorial value of any number.

One thing to note that bigger will be the number more time it will be going to take 
for finding the factorial.

It is made by using HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
